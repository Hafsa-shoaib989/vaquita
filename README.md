## Creating a New Branch

When working on new features or fixing issues, creating a separate branch is a good practice. Follow these steps to create a new branch:

1. Make sure you are in the main branch using the command:
   
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Create a new branch using the following command, replacing `branch_name` with your desired branch name (e.g., `SS`):
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b branch_name
   ```

3. You are now switched to the new branch and can start making changes.

## Switching to a Different Branch

If you need to switch to a different branch, use the following command:

```bash
git switch branch_name
```

Replace `branch_name` with the branch name you want to switch to.

## Branch Management Table

Use the table below to keep track of team members and their corresponding branch names:

| Team Member | Branch Name |
|-------------|-------------|
| Hamna, Maira  | HMS       |
| Abdul Samad, Saad    | SS   |
| Hafsa, Hassan  | HH        |


Feel free to update this table as your team members create and work on different branches.
